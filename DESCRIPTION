Title: CALCULATES the SPI and SPEI USING NASA POWER DATA
Version: 0.1.0

Description: The PowerSDI calculates the SPI and SPEI using NASA POWER data.
    It also calculates these indices using a reference data source.
    The functions ScientSDI.R, Accuracy.R and Reference.R verify,
    if the SPI and SPEI frequency distributions meet the normality assumption
    and how well NASAPOWER estimates represent “real-world” data.
    The OperatSDI.R function calculates the indices in an operational/routine mode.
    The PowerSDI also calculates potential evapotranspitation amounts (PE) and,
    the difference between rainfall (P) and EP (PEP).
    The package adopts a basic time scale that splits each month into four subperiods.
    Days 1 to 7, days 8 to 14, days 15 to 21, and days 22 to 28, 29, 30, or 31 depending on the month.
    TS=4 corresponds to a 12-month length moving (calculated 4 times a month).
    TS=48 corresponds to a 1-month length moving (calculated 4 times a month).
    This time scale (TS) is referred as to quart.month.
