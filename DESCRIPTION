Description: The PowerSDI is calculates the SPI and SPEI from NASA POWER data.
    It calculates these two indices from scientific and operational viewpoints.
    The functions ScientSDI.R, Accuracy.R and Reference.R verifies
    If the SPI and SPEI frequency distributions meet the normality assumption.
    How well NASAPOWER estimates represent “real-world” data.
    The OperatSDI.R function calculates both SPI and SPEI in an operational mode.
    The PowerSDI adopts a basic time scale that splits each month into four subperiods.
    Days 1 to 7, days 8 to 14, days 15 to 21, and days 22 to 28, 29, 30, or 31 depending on the month.
    TS=4 corresponds to a 12-month length moving (calculated 4 times a month).
    TS=48 corresponds to a 1-month length moving (calculated 4 times a month).
    This time scale (TS) is referred as to quart.month.
