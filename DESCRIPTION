Description: A set of functions designed to calculate the standardized precipitation and
    standardized precipitation 'evapotranspiration' indices using NASA POWER data.
    It also calculates these indices using a reference data source.
    The functions verify if the indices estimates meet the normality assumption
    and how well NASA POWER estimates represent real world data.
    It also calculates the indices in a routine mode.
    The package also estimates potential 'evapotranspiration' amounts and
    the difference between rainfall and potential 'evapotranspiration'.
    The functions adopt a basic time scale that splits each month into four periods.
    Days 1 to 7, days 8 to 14, days 15 to 21, and days 22 to 28, 29, 30, or 31.
    TS=4 corresponds to a 12-month length moving (calculated 4 times a month).
    TS=48 corresponds to a 1-month length moving (calculated 4 times a month).
